## Building and submitting the iOS .ipa file

Before building, it is important to know that there are two configuration that manage the app.

Expo.plist - Manages Expo settings (mostly for updates and release channel config)
Info.plist - Manages All iOS settings (won't be edited manually but will change when changing settings in XCode)

### Before building

1. make sure you have xcode installed (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
2. make sure to add your account to xcode (via settings)

### Build .ipa file

1. Ensure the app dependencies are all up to date

- JS deps

`yarn` from root

- Native Deps

`npx pod-install` from `mobile` directory

2. Run `yarn bump-versions` and commit the changes
3. If building for stage, run `yarn prebuild-stage` in the mobile folder
4. Open `mobile/ios/Gather.xcworkspace` with the latest XCode
5. Inspect the Expo.plist and make sure `EXUpdatesReleaseChannel` is the desired release channel
6. Select "Any iOS Device" to target under the simulator selection menu (command-shift-k)
7. Select "Product" menubar option and then "Clean Build Folder"
8. Select "Product" again, then "Archive" (this step actually builds the ipa file and should take just a few mins.)

### Submit to Apple

After the last step above, an ipa file should be created and a new window that shows the Gather app will appear. To submit to apple do:

1. Open `Window` > `Organiser` in the menu bar.
2. Select Gather and the build that you want to upload
3. Click the blue button "Distribute App"
4. Select "App Store Connect"
5. Select "Upload"
6. Leave all options checked and click "Next" on the next page
7. Select "Automatically manage signing"
8. Select "Upload" (this will upload to app store connect and show up in testflight to use for testing)

### Adding build for Apple TestFlight

1. Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/ -> "My Apps"
2. Navigate to the app you submitted
3. Click on the "TestFlight" tab
4. Accept the terms under the newly submitted build
